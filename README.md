# SunshineWatchface

## Project Overview
In this project, I have built a wearable watch face for Sunshine to run on an Android Wear device.

## Why this Project?
Android Wear is an exciting way to integrate apps more directly into usersâ€™ lives. As a developer, it's important to understand how to perform this integration. This project gives me an opportunity to design a companion app for Sunshine, tying it to a watch face in order to enrich the experience.

## What Have I learnt?
Through this project, I have:

* Understoodd the fundamentals of Android Wear.
* Designed for multiple watch form factors.
* Communicated between a mobile device and a wearable device.
